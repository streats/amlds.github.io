<p>An <a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/beauty/beauty-fails-people-with-disabilities-loreal-estee-lauder-unilever-wants-to-change-that">article on Vogue Business about improvements in accessibility in the beauty industry</a> includes some charts and graphs which have alt descriptions which do not effectively describe the image.</p>

<p>For example, this image of a chart:</p>

<p><img src="https://media.voguebusiness.com/photos/60db48dbb3326e449dab62fb/master/w_1600,c_limit/chart-inline-21-story-inline-1.jpg" alt="A chart titled &quot;Percentage of US households with a member who identifies with a disability&quot;, showing that 20% identify with &quot;Physical limitations&quot;, 8% &quot;Vision difficulty&quot;, 7% &quot;Hearing difficulty&quot;, 6% &quot;Independent living difficulty&quot;, 6% &quot;Learning difficulty&quot;, &quot;3% Intellectual disability&quot;. n = 46, 874 respondents. Survey taken between March - April 2016. Data source: Nielsen's reaching prevalent, diverse consumers with disabilities report, 2016. " /></p>

<p>However the alt text for this image says “Image may contain Text Plot Number and Symbol”, and the body text of the page does not explain the chart content.</p>

<p>In addition, these images cannot easily be viewed in full size (user has to know how to open image in a new tab, for example, or download/save the image)</p>
