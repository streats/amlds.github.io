<p>Something I used in my previous life as a product manager.</p>

<p>Note: This is from before I knew anything about accessibility, so does not explicitly cover accessibility issues.</p>

<h2 id="priority-1---highest-urgent">Priority 1 - Highest (Urgent)</h2>

<p>These are ‘launchblockers’, or even in some cases ‘someone needs to wake up right now’</p>

<ul>
  <li>Security, privacy, or life-altering information is compromised
    <ul>
      <li>Security cert or encryption fails</li>
      <li>User is shown or able to access another user’s information</li>
      <li>Incorrect information or advice shown which could be life-altering (financial, health, legal, etc)</li>
      <li>Legal or regulatory risk (for example, GDPR non-compliance)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>App is completely inaccessible or unusable
    <ul>
      <li>Browser crashes or freezes</li>
      <li>Page is blank or inaccessible</li>
      <li>UI elements broken such that it renders the page unusable</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="priority-2---high">Priority 2 - High</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Functionality is broken such that user cannot proceed or cannot perform a core action:
    <ul>
      <li>Unresponsive UI elements</li>
      <li>Infinite or unreasonably long page loading time</li>
      <li>Broken links</li>
      <li>Error that is unresolvable by the user</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="priority-3---medium">Priority 3 - Medium</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Functionality technically works but usability is severely affected:
    <ul>
      <li>UI elements distorted or mispositioned making them hard to access or interact with</li>
      <li>Visual or textual elements are not intuitive, potentially inhibits uses understanding of feature</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="priority-4---low">Priority 4 - Low</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Core design elements are incorrectly implemented:
    <ul>
      <li>Brand colours</li>
      <li>Typography</li>
      <li>UI components (buttons, selection components)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Design details that affect polish or slickness of the products, but do not impact usability:
    <ul>
      <li>Minor inconsistencies in size or positioning of UI elements</li>
      <li>Design or wording is inconsistent with other parts of the app</li>
      <li>Animation or interaction is missing or incorrect</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
